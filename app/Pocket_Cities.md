<h1> Pocket Cities </h1>

<h3> MISSION STATEMENT </h3>

Give players the ability to create and play a Tomagotchi-esque "pocket" city. 

Features:

  - 3D rotating playing space
  - Box graphics, no texture 
  - Out of many small boxes we can build intricate buildings
  - Walking minature boxy people (can zoom in)
  - Animations of box people interacting
  

<h4> Unpredictability </h4>

Unpredicatability and variety is at the heart of the game, since we are simulating "real" chaos 

Elements of unpredictability and variety:
  - There are many different and unexpected ways of playing the game
  - Players can create their own items, give individual names, and assign perks
  - Players can level up character as in an RPG
  - RPG characters abilities become unlocked at high levels 
  - RPG characters can be equiped with custom user created items 
  - Trade can be initiated in multiplayer
  - Clans and clan warfare can be taken advantage of 
  
  - Random population flashes in "clouds of probability" based on proximity of buildings
  - Population is also attracted to the right ratio of buildings
  - Other reason for magnetizing higher numbers of population:
  - ... lots of stores (mentioned in the tutorial) 
  - ... crime free area
  - ... education
  - ... interactions AI

<H2> RANDOM POPULATION AI </H2>

Population in groups of 100


Among that group of 100: 
  - Percentage that is a certain way, "X", displays certain behaviors
  - class populationpercentagebehavior module 
  - x percent is going to display behavior qualities: 
  - ... educated (keep algorithm secret) 
  - ... wealthy
  - ... crime meter
  - ... conversion rate (random population is willing to convert to behavior based on surrounding population)
  - ... create random system
  - ... probability cloud
  - ... job
  - ... jobless

<h2> A random but ordered system </h2>

  - ... indicate how each affects one another for a random ordered system
  
  - be able to analyze these in the log, mission control log
  - create class missioncontrol.py 
  - 
  
  
  
  Create nameless mythology for block city for game intro, and game consistency. 
  
  Let player generate extra people up until their mana meter runs out. This gives the player an enjoyable repeatable action. In multiplayer face to face, players can have lots of fun generating people at a faster pace. 
  
  When people destroyed, instead of blood you see rainbow marked spray paint.

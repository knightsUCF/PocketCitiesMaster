<h1> Pocket Cities </h1>

<h2> MISSION STATEMENT </h2>

Give players the ability to create and play a Tomagotchi-esque "pocket" city. 

<h4> Unpredictability </h4>

Unpredicatability and variety is at the heart of the game, since we are simulating "real" chaos 

Elements of unpredictability and variety:
  - There are many different and unexpected ways of playing the game
  - Players can create their own items, give individual names, and assign perks
  - Players can level up character as in an RPG
  - RPG characters abilities become unlocked at high levels 
  - RPG characters can be equiped with custom user created items 
  - Trade can be initiated in multiplayer
  - Clans and clan warfare can be taken advantage of 
  
  - Random population flashes in "clouds of probability" based on proximity of buildings
  - Population is also attracted to the right ratio of buildings
  - Other reason for magnetizing higher numbers of population:
    - lots of stores (mentioned in the tutorial) 
    -

<h1> Pocket Cities </h1>

<h2> MISSION STATEMENT </h2>

Give players the ability to create and play a Tomagotchi-esque "pocket" city. 

<h4> Unpredictability </h4>

Unpredicatability and variety is at the heart of the game, since we are simulating "real" chaos 

Elements of unpredictability and variety:
  - There are many different and unexpected ways of playing the game
  - Players can create their own items, give individual names, and assign perks
  - Players can level up character as in an RPG
  - RPG characters abilities become unlocked at high levels 
  - RPG characters can be equiped with custom user created items 
  - Trade can be initiated in multiplayer
  - Clans and clan warfare can be taken advantage of 
  
  - Random population flashes in "clouds of probability" based on proximity of buildings
  - Population is also attracted to the right ratio of buildings
  - Other reason for magnetizing higher numbers of population:
  - ... lots of stores (mentioned in the tutorial) 
  - ... crime free area
  - ... education
  - ... interactions AI

<H2> RANDOM POPULATION AI </H2>

Population in groups of 100


Among that group of 100: 
  - Percentage that is a certain way, "X", displays certain behaviors
  - class populationpercentagebehavior module 
  - x percent is going to display behavior qualities: 
  - ... educated (keep algorithm secret) 
  - ... wealthy
  - ... crime meter
  - ... conversion rate (random population is willing to convert to behavior based on surrounding population)
  - ... create random system
  - ... probability cloud
  - ... job
  - ... jobless

<h2> A random but ordered system </h2>

  - ... indicate how each affects one another for a random ordered system
  
  - be able to analyze these in the log, mission control log
  - create class missioncontrol.py 
  -
